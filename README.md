# Machine Learning on fMRI data

Team contributors: Mikkel Schöttner

## Summary 

This project will use machine learning on an openly accessable fMRI data set. Suitable data sets can for example be found on [OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/public/datasets).

## Project definition 

### Background

TO DO: Include background.

### Tools 

The project will rely on the following technologies:

- nilearn
- scikit-learn
- HPC/compute Canada

### Data 

One of the [OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/public/datasets) datasets, for example [this one](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000221/versions/00002)

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:

 - a Python script that contains the main analysis
 - a Jupyter notebook that includes preparation of the data, visualization, explanations etc.
